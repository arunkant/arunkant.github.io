[Intro]\
_Is this the feature live? Is this just test-ci?\
Conflict in a git merge, no reviews or code quality\
Copy your keys, ssh to the cloud and see\
I'm just a junior dev, I need no stablity\
Because I version bump, tag repo, google Stack, Over-flow\
Any way the build goes doesn't really matter to me, to me_

[Verse 1]\
_Mama, just lost a branch\
Did rebase against its HEAD, pressed the enter, now it's dead\
Mama, work had just begun\
But now I've gone and thrown it all away\
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to break on Fri\
If the patch not back again this time tomorrow\
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters_


[Verse 2]\
_Too late, release time has come\
Sends changes down pipeline, asserts failing arbit time\
Git push, everybody, we've got to go\
Gotta deploy it all to prod and fix post hoc\
Mama, ooh, (Any way the build goes)\
I messed up API\
I sometimes wish I'd written any tests at all_


[Verse 3]\
_I see a client mail shit hit the fan\
Hotfix, hotfix, will you rollback django?\
Deployment and live-env, very, very fright'ning me\
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico\
But I'm just a junior dev, quality assurance bugs me\
He's just a junior dev from the js family\
Save his deadline mark legacy-compatibility\
Version bump, tag repo, will you let it go?\
Bismillah! No, we will not let it go\
(Let it go!) Bismillah! We will not let it go\
(Let it go!) Bismillah! We will not let it go\
(Let it go) Will not let it go\
(Let it go) Will not let it go\
(Let it go) Ah\
No, no, no, no, no, no, no\
(Oh c'mon qa, c'mon qa) c'mon qa, let it go\
Github has a polyfill, ray of light for me, for me, for me!_


[Verse 4]\
_So you think you can reverse proxy and rewrite URIs?\
So you think you can copy-paste and leave me to DRY?\
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\
Just gotta pep8, just gotta pep-right-8 of the PR_


[Outro]\
_Logging rarely matters, println and see\
Logging rarely matters\
Logging rarely matters to me\
Any way the build goes_
